🎥 Real Life Violence Detection Dataset

📂 Dataset Overview
The Real Life Violence Detection Dataset was created during our graduation project titled "Violence Recognition from Videos". While researching this topic, we discovered a significant shortage of publicly available datasets focusing on violent interactions between individuals. To fill this gap, we developed a diverse dataset that includes various scenes capturing both violent and non-violent human interactions.

📄 Contents
This dataset contains a total of 2000 videos, divided into:

1000 Violence Videos: Featuring real-world violent interactions, such as street fights, captured in a variety of environments and conditions.
1000 Non-Violence Videos: Depicting a wide range of non-violent activities, such as:
Sports (e.g., football, basketball)
Everyday actions (e.g., walking, eating, dancing)
📝 Dataset Details:
Violent Videos: Real street fight scenarios, with varying lighting, weather conditions, and backgrounds.
Non-Violent Videos: Collected from various human actions to ensure diversity in everyday activities.
🛠️ Usage
This dataset is ideal for:

Deep Learning & Computer Vision tasks, especially video-based violence detection.
Research & Engineering in security systems, automated surveillance, and behavioural analysis.
When using this dataset in any research or engineering context, please ensure to cite the original publication provided above.

🏷️ Sample Data
You can explore sample videos from both the violent and non-violent categories to familiarize yourself with the dataset’s diversity. These samples include scenes from everyday life as well as intense real-world confrontations.
